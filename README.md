# AttendaBot

**_Face Recognition Attendance System for Students with Real-Time Database_**

## Project Description

AttendaBot is a Python-based attendance system that uses face recognition to automatically mark students' attendance. By leveraging OpenCV's computer vision methods and Firebase's real-time database capabilities, this project simplifies the attendance process, providing a fast and secure solution for educational institutions.

## Features

- **Face Recognition**: Automatically detects and recognizes student faces using OpenCV.
- **Real-Time Database**: Attendance data is updated instantly in the Firebase Realtime Database.
- **Python Integration**: The system's core logic is written in Python, ensuring flexibility and ease of use.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secures user data and ensures authorized access.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For face detection and recognition.
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: For storing attendance records in real time.
- **Firebase Authentication**: For managing and securing access.
- **Numpy, Pillow**: For image processing and manipulation.
